## YouTube
Provide a URL, a save location, and whether you want the .mp4 or the .mp3. The file will have the same name as the video.

## MP3 Troubleshooting
If MP3 files fails to convert properly, you probably need this installed: https://ffmpeg.org/download.html

To use this, download from packages & executable files, and move that to your home directory.
